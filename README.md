## Acknowledgments

* Kaggle is a great site for data science exploration
* **ChatGPT** and **Copilot** have been very helpful taking my analysis ideas and making it happen with code. These tools cannot complete the project on their own, but they are very helpful for completing code segments. This was my first time using assistance with writing code, and it saved tremendous amounts of time.
